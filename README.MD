# Java Code for Querying HuggingFace Text Generation Models

## Overview

This Java code allows you to interact with Hugging Face models by querying the API and engaging in conversation with the model. While this code provides a basic implementation, it offers a starting point for integrating Hugging Face models into your Java projects, especially Android projects.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Insert your Hugging Face API URL and API token into the appropriate placeholders in Main.java.
2. An example on how to run the code is implemented in Main.java file.
3. Run the application to initiate conversation with the Hugging Face model.

## Note

please note that this code is an experimental code, I wrote it to try out hugging face text generation models.
